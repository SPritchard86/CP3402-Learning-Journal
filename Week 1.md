# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
### Monday

### Tuesday

### Wednesday
- Today I attempted the self-test questions.
- I also began working through the LinkedIn learning course recommended: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development-14628245
- Browsed through W3Schools HTML section to saturate myself in HTML code.


## Estimated Hours
### Wednesday
 - Est. 3 hours self directed learning.

## Content Insights
- I've come to the realization that I have a lot to re-learn. I'll have to do some quick catch-up in the next week or so.
- A lot of the general knowledge/information in the Linkedin Learning course I'm already well-versed in; I think mostly I need to specifically work on syntax and methods of building in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- If you don't use it, you lose it! I used to be quite comfortable with web-based development (HTML,CSS), yet now I have a lot to brush up on.
